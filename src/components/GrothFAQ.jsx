    },
    {
        question: "I don’t want to run ‘salesy’ or unethical ads.",
        answer: "Neither do we. We follow a 100% ethical, patient-first approach no false claims, no fear-based marketing. Your reputation and ethics stay intact.",

        question:
            "I’m already listed on Practo or JustDial – isn’t that enough?",

        question: "How much time will this take from me?",

        question: "I have staff. Why do I need automation?",

    },
    {
        question: "What if I don’t get results?",

    {
        question: "I don’t understand tech. Will I be able to use this?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You don't need to log in or manage anything. You'll get a simple mobile report and alerts. We manage the system end-to-end you just get leads and bookings",
